The key here is reciprocity - I will review yours if you review mine.\nBut how do we find people who have the skills we need??\nProblem Finding code reviewers is difficult. Code reviewing when there are more researchers than RSE is not sustainable, there needs to be something more sustainable.\nTime-poor RSEs often don’t have time to search out people who can help, nor do we want to spend lots of time reviewing others’ code while getting nothing in return.\nRSEs and researchers might also not be able to attend in-person events, or might not be in a position to make connections outside their field, and often the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas is what we need to really improve our code or projects.\nFinding code reviewers is hard and there needs to be a more sustainable way to code review other people’s code rather than relying on RSE RSEs and researchers might also not be able to attend in-person events, or might not be in a position to make connections outside their field, and often the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas is what we need to really improve our code or projects. Tricky to know what people feel confident enough to help with Solution A buddy/pairing system based on people’s expertise. Basic user profile generated by user The software can add to a cupid (web/HTML) profile by crawling through their public GitHub/Twitter/Linken account to fetch statistics, such as commonly used programming languages, domain expertise, commonly used scientific terms in their Tweets…. The cupid profile may also contain A user written bio Key skills users can contribute (e.g. documentation) Skills users are looking for help with (e.g. testing) What they want to review and be reviewed he statistic can be used to make a similarity score between pairs of cupid profiles_._ Can make use of existing GitHub stats software eg https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats together with other existing software to crawl through public accounts and fetch statistics.\nWhat we need to make Code Review Cupid a reality:\nSofter skills / self-reflection skill-description advice documentation options for non-coders who want to get involved Code review tips documentation - ideal for folks who’ve got Code Review experience! Web skills and DB options for the backend matching algorithm query magics required data entry form design for participant data gathering design skills needed for frontend The team/time can be divided with the following objectives:\nBasic Level:\nWeb / Design :_ Code Review Cupid website (the backend could be written in Django) - _Web design and generation for a single cupid profile, given the short time frame, it can either be static or dynamic Data: Basic profile generation (bio, ‘confident with’ and ‘would like help with’ skillset keyword selection, social profile links, contact preferences) Docs: Pointers to existing documentation resources (e.g. code review advice, tips - _Suggestions on how to carry out a code review, give and receive helpful feedback and more. _) DB / Web: Small database of participant data (their skill sets, software engineering specialties and interests, etc, perhaps as a table listing software technologies and skills as columns and coders as rows) Data: Keyword match / complementarity between profiles aka _Matchmaking algorithm: _ ? users could select whether they want to find someone with same skills (match e.g. “wants x” matches “wants x”) or complimentary skills (inverse match e.g. “has x, wants y” would match with “has y, wants x”) Design: Logo :D Design: Presentation Docs: Decide on code of conduct Tasks/Ideas for Non-coders: documentation, design, data-entry form design, keywords ontologies?, code of conduct, logo,\nEven Smaller Prototype Note: if we don’t have sufficient web-stuff up and running, we could at least generate some example profiles with example data, figure out some data-matching methods, and create an outline data-collection form / data structure?\nStretch Levels (optional features)\nHard and optional: implementing a similarity score between pairs of cupid profiles Find existing (or implement) software to draw useful statistics from a user’s public GitHub, Twitter, …etc to be displayed on the cupid profile Try and balance matching experts with beginners Social media ‘likes’ or credit system to show credibility of a user Newly developed resources / documentation: _Advice on how to fill out your profile to get the best results _ Tips on how to build and maintain your coder buddy partnership in future The algorithm could also help suggest potential reviewers or authors that an applicant might consider contacting after they’re happy with their code Diagrams / illustrations FA: possible logo?\nSkillsets:\nSL: an RSE, ML \u0026 stats, scientific computing (python, R, C++), no java/html5 web dev. Can do static HTML tho. Knows Java.\nFA: PhD Researcher, R, some Python, collaborative coding experience w/ students, documentation, data (mostly in R)\nDN: an RSE, numerical simulation, HPC skills, C++, C, django\nJS: an RSE, software development, Java (including a little web thing running from a database), html5, css, Ajax for web,\nJT: mech eng background, FORTRAN, python, R, MATLAB,\nAMAA: comp sci \u0026 applied maths, python, some HTML,\nDW: an RSE, physics/bio, django web apps, vue.js Javascript frontend, patchy availability due to puppy :D\nDB: maths modeller,\nIB: an RSE team leader,\n—\nVision for the product:\nSL: pair matching folks with matching expertise to help establish buddy connections for sustainable code review.\nWeb page containing a person’s CRC profile (bio, prog lang prefs, expertise, etc), potentially grabbed by a public crawler which pulls data from linked profiles (e.g. github, twitter)\nMore data is better, so public data on the profile can help people decide.\nStats can help pair.\nFA: thinking about generating minimal profile examples and how to match the data. Perhaps supply list of keywords and ontologies to connect similar terms / complimentary skills. Basic data entry form would be a good proof of concept.\nDN: Thinking about database holding the profile information - tables of skills people have vs skills people want? Django might be a good backend because it handles DB parts, and frontend might be html/javascript for web interface\nSuggestions / Discussion:\nJS: this might be a good product for people to find their ‘rubber duck+’ - ie someone who can listen to your idea and ask helpful critical questions to help you improve it\nJS: perhaps wouldn’t go for Django, might go Java instead personally\nJS: for the hack day, it might be helpful to just match similar keywords from the skills DB, but in future it might be a good idea to offer several ‘algorithm options’ (ie user could select if they prefer x to x, or x to y matching). +1 from DW.\nDW: following on from DN’s Django database visions - perhaps might be better to keep 1 table which doesn’t separate reviewers vs reviewees, perhaps with a couple of boolean flags for indicating whether a user is a reviewer or reviewee\nJT: Try and balance matching experts with beginners, do we need to offer credit? Having a credit system might help people review\nSL: Social media ‘likes’ or credit system to show credibility of a user\nAMAA: a credit system might be helpful - if you’re an intermediate python writer, you might look for a more experienced reviewer, but can offer to review beginners’ code.\nDN: a mathematical model might be great, but it could be less complex for implementation in the short term.\nJS +1 to DN’s idea to add future ideas to github issues\nFA: to think about minimal example\nJS: recently github website w/ Jekyll template with specification requirements for a student - puts them up as issues.\nJT: thinking about the papers review system - selecting several reviewers who could review your paper, and they could also decide whether to\nSL: can we reduce intimidation barriers to people reviewing code?\nJS: kudos systems can be gamed - people might upvote/downvote to get credit. To make sure people don’t get intimidated, this would be helpful\nDB: we could keep rankings blind to avoid ‘gaming’.\nJT: the more code you review, the higher a ‘level’ you might achieve in our scoring system.\nDN: this ‘scoring’ could be a good feature to put into our documentation / TODOs issues instead of an initial prototype feature. Points may or may not be visible/blind to other users.\nWhat information do we need to help users decide whether to get in touch with a code review buddy?\nCredibility / amount of code someone’s written / stage of career (e.g. look at their bio, keywords), ‘credit’ (likes/reposts/review stats). What are their skills What kind of work do they do How long have they been doing it? Are they an approachable person / reviewer? MVP: minimal viable product:\nDW: How would users get in touch with each other? Would we build a messaging platform?\nFA: Perhaps instead, users specify their preferred contact method which is revealed to their match one the match is made.\nJT: we need to think about data security!\nFA: Fictitious data to deal with GDPR, but worth mentioning in our presentation\nJS: could use github pages, csv file \u0026 Heroku (free) to host. (JS’s example is here: https://github.com/NewcastleRSE/WorkshopScheduler)\nDW (post-hoc): pythonanywhere is another option for a python-based backend (e.g. reprohack hub is hosted on pythonanywhere)\nTODOs:\nChoose license (DONE)\nCollaboration guidance for project\nChoose code of conduct for product\nMake Repo with relevant gitignore / license\nTeam photo\nCreate website\nCreate presentation\nCreate mock profile data\nCreate github issues for these TODOs :)\nPresentations \u0026 Demos at 1550!\nJanetta - website setup\nDeclan - database \u0026 data generation\nSherman - website \u0026 static html\nDmitry, Jiada - README, documentation. Projects\nJiada - been working on README with Dmitry. TO CONTINUE.\nSherman - static website, no interaction with the database, created profile from the mock data. Has score, some social media bit, list of skills and key words. Middle shows username, pic, whether they can review or want to be reviewed. Biog, history, etc.\nJannetta - web app on Heroku, Readme in the website repo within the organisation.\nTODO: landing page for website\nTODO: data entry form for new user profile.\nTODO: presentation discussion.\nSL: should perhaps avoid slides, and the demo person should talk. Then after the demo we can talk, one person speaking at a time.\nSL: in terms of demoing and talking about it, then at least one person afterwards.\nSL: opening section (describe product, objectives, then present product, then further implementations)\n3x folks, then speaking only for 1min each.\nLicence: These materials (unless otherwise specified) are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Licence.
