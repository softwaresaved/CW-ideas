### **Idea name (provisional)**


**Hello World! (of CI/CD)**


### **Context / Research Domain**


Software engineering


### **Problem**


Build a Hello World app (but make it support continuous deployment.)

This hack day idea is more about developing skills, and less about the idea itself. 

I want to gain experience using best practices like TDD and CI/CD, but I never seem to get around to actually doing it. I also want to explore different ways of collaborating on a group leaning/coding exercise, so this is also about experimenting with that.


### **Solution**

I like the idea of doing this as a ‘mob programming’ exercise with a small group of other developers, the idea being that we can learn from and motivate each other. Maybe the end result can be packaged as an activity and/or group learning format for others to use and benefit from, but it isn’t a requirement.

Some tutorials that might serve as starting point:

I think a cookbook of CI/CD recipes would be a great potential output!
