Context / Research Domain The problem covers the domain of training and education for new users of interpreted languages.
Problem Existing tools to support training are either too simplistic, resulting in a steep learning curve for students who need to install complex environments and understand packaging systems or command-line REPL interfaces, or too complex, aiming to streamline the user experience to a level that presents too many choices and provides a cluttered interface.</description></item><item><title>Teaching programming to researchers across all research domains</title><link>https://softwaresaved.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-teaching-programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://softwaresaved.github.io/CW-ideas/cw18-teaching-programming/</guid><description>Collaborations Workshop 2018 - 2018-03-26 Group D - Collaborative Ideas - CI12-CW18

Initial ideas:
Giving instantaneous feedback to students on the quality of their programming Updating f2py to work with Python 3 (this may already be done in numpy) Py2f to call python from Fortran Visualising your data in many common visualisations to help you choose the right one Improving Dianaâ€™s visualisations of refugee migration simulations Context / Research Domain Teaching programming to researchers across all research domains.</description></item></channel></rss>
