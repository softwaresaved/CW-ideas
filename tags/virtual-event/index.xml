Hackday Idea Proposer Emmy (slack @Emmy Tsang)
Context / Research Domain Many collaborative events / workshops are moving online because of the COVID-19 situation; but more generally– can we run events like the CW hackday online, and what would it take?
Problem How do we facilitate effective collaboration in a virtual event, where:
People have to work across multiple time zones: all conversations/communications need to be documented some way on a channel that everyone in the team (at least) can access and consume easily It’s more difficult, esp for newcomers, to get to know other people There’s a lack of watercooler/coffee machine conversations Version control and tracking changes could be trickier?</description></item></channel></rss>
